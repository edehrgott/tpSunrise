tpSunrise is a is a 3 column theme with a vertical menu on the left. The theme supports 2 widgetized sidebars 
on the right and a flexible center column that automatically adjusts for the window width.

This theme supports a slightly different style for the home page and the sub pages. The home page is intended 
to be more graphical and can accommodate a different header graphic and left sidebar background. The main css 
file (style.css) is styled for the sub pages. The home page styles are affected using jQuery through the 
nav_background_alt.php file. 

The home page header graphic is in images/tekpals_liquid_big_header.png and the sub page header is at
images/tekpals_liquid_sub_header.png. These filenames may be changed in home_logo.php and sub_logo.php as needed.

The theme uses one WordPress 3 menu and presents the menu as a vertical menu down the left sidebar. The theme uses 
an image (images/gradient31.gif) to style the themes; this does limit the length of the text for the menus. If you 
prefer, you can remove or change the image to accommodate longer menu names. This left sidebar is intended for 
navigation only and is not widgetized.

Since this is a variable width theme, you need to pay attention to the width of images. It is suggest that you modify
the settings/media section of the administrative area to disply medium images at no more than 500x500 and large
images at no more than 900x900. Keep in mind that large images may not display as inended on screens less than 1024
pixels wide.

This is my first theme intended for wide distribution; I would appreciate comments. I have some other themes in process
to meet specialized layout requirements. I wanted to give something back to the many people who helped me learn CSS, 
WordPress, php and jQuery through their blogs. Thanks!

It is completely optional, but if you like the theme I would appreciate it if you keep the credit link in the footer.
